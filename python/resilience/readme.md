```python
@async_method
@try_catch()
@auto_transaction
@with_timeout()
@circuit_breaker(name="async_executemany")
@profile
async def executemany(self, sql: str, param_list: List[tuple], timeout: Optional[float] = None, tags: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> List[Tuple]:
```

This arrangement has the following benefits:

When circuit is open:

* circuit_breaker short-circuits immediately
* No profile logging occurs
* No thread/task is created for timeout
* No transaction is started
* Minimal overhead for rejected requests


When circuit is closed but function times out:

* Function is cancelled
* While profile logging won't capture the timeout due to cancellation, that's actually desirable
* Circuit breaker still records the failure
* Transaction is properly rolled back
* Error is wrapped by try_catch


When circuit is closed and function succeeds:

* Full profiling occurs
* Circuit breaker records success
* Transaction is committed
* No error to wrap
